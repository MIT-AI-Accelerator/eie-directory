Data
---------

Storm EVent ImagRy (SEVIR) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over 10k spatially and temporally aligned image sequences from 5 weather sensors, including visible and infrared satellite, weather radar, and the geostationary lightning mapper.  Many samples in SEVIR correspond to NOAA’s Storm Event Database. For more info see [webpage](sevir.mit.edu).  

Size: Approximately 1TB.  Total number of videos: 76k   Total number of image frames across all videos:   3.7 million 

Location: Available on MIT Supercloud system (requires you to be a member of the EarthIntelligence group).  Located in EarthIntelligence/datasets/SEVIR 

Link:  Not yet available.   We plan to upload to AWS in summer 2020. 

Other info: Software repo (including demos on how to use the dataset)
